Keyboard handling in Xamarin IOS
Do you want to ease [iOS Keyboard handling in Xamarin App Development](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/ease-ios-keyboard-handling-xamarin-app-development/)? If your answer is ‘Yes’, then this tutorial is for you. 

In this tutorial, I have listed out different problems with solutions through codes that usually Xamarin developers are facing while coding in Xamarin iOS Library for Keyboard handling. I have solved below problem through codes.    

1. Add a “Return” Button in place of Enter Key in Keyboard.
2. When the Keyboard loses focus, close the Keyboard and return to the Normal state of the screen
3. Add Next/Previous/Done Button in Keyboard
4. Move the View Up/Down if Keyboard is hiding your TextField/View

I programmed this code while working in one of my live projects at Space-O Technologies, ISO certified [mobile app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/mobile-app-development/) in India.
